# Sales_Analysis

## Overview  
This project explores sales data to uncover trends and patterns that can help businesses optimize revenue and operations. The analysis includes insights into seasonal sales, customer demographics, and product performance, supported by an interactive dashboard for better decision-making.  

## Objective  
The primary aim of this analysis was to identify seasonal sales trends, categorize customer demographics and their purchasing behavior, and analyze product and category performance. This was done to provide actionable recommendations for boosting store revenue and improving inventory decisions.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and consists of 30,000 rows and 21 columns. It includes attributes like sales dates, product categories, revenue figures, customer demographics (such as age groups and regions), and stock levels.  

## Tools and Techniques  
For this project, I used Excel to clean and preprocess the data, create pivot tables for insights, and apply conditional formatting to identify trends. Statistical formulas were also used to evaluate performance. Additionally, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights key findings and trends.
